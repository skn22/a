2. To Execute at least 10 queries on any suitable MongoDB database that demonstrates following:
$ where queries(compare the values for two keys in a document, for instance, if we had a list of
items and wanted to return documents where any two of the values are equal),
Cursors (Limits, skips, sorts, advanced query options) take the result set of the query which
finds the Employee's whose id is greater than 2 and assign it to the JavaScript variable
'myEmployee' then use loop to iterate through all of the documents which are returned as part of
the query and finally, print each document, in JSON readable format.
Database commands(check the number of documents affected by an update, drop a collection
from the shell) .

db.employees.insertMany([
    { _id: 1, name: "Alice", age: 30, department: "Sales", salary: 50000, bonus: 5000 },
